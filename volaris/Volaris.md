# Nirys And The Fate of Dragons

![token_1](../assets/token_1.png)

Purple dragons treat family as their greatest treasure. Nirys might not die for his children, but he will fight tooth and claw for their survival. He acts as a crime lord, dispensing others to do his dirty work.  Nirys and Nara were together for 280 years, averaging a new dragon every 2~0 years, they have 13 living children. 

Nirys hates other dragons the most for killing his wife, Nara. For this reason he killed as many dragons as he could. Dragons get stronger as they age, Nirys believes that this generational empowerment should be for his line alone. Nara was killed by a Red Dragon named Imot, The Deathlord.

Nirys hands control to his children according to their demonstrated aptitude. He recruits rogues to gather information with promises of wealth, Fighters and Barbarians with promises of magic items, and Wizards with promises of arcane lore.

Nirys provided his adult children rings enhanced with a self polymorph so they could assume long term personas. 



## Cicles of the Arcanist

Nirys loves magicâ€”or the power to make the imagination real, as he put it ages ago. Loyalist wizards are invited to join or be promoted to higher circles. These circles are based on the level of spell slot they have attained 1-9 and a 10th circle which Nirys views as those wizards that are worthy of his time.

### 1st Circle

Wizards are invited to join the first circle at levels after level one if they demonstrate that they are loyal to Volaris. As long as you continue to show fealty to Volaris and the crown you can retain your position in this circle and recieve a weekly income of 100 GP

### 2nd Circle

After a wizard hits 3rd level they can be invited to be promoted from the 1st to 2nd circle. For every month a wizard is in this circle, they recieve an Aether Quartz for their own enhancement studies.

### 3rd Circle

After a wizard hits 5th level they can be promoted from 2nd to 3rd circle. Weekly payments increase to 200 GP. A 3rd circle mage also get a 10% discount when they shop at any shop enrolled in the program (DM's should probably assume shops in cities are loyalists enrolled and shops outside of major cities are not).

### 4th Circle

After a wizard has attained 7th level they may be advanced to 4th circle. Weekly income is increased to 300 GP. Wizards of this circle are also given a Skyfire Opal once a month in addition to an Aether Quartz

### 9th Circle

After a wizard has attained 17th level they may be advanced to 9th. Wizards of this circle. Every month wizards of this circle recieve a Voidstone in addition to the Skyfire Opal and Aether Quartz they recieve. Their weekly income is increased to 3000 GP.

### 10th Circle

After a wizard has attained 19th level they may be advanced to 10th. Wizards of this circle are taught the truth about Nirys and the fate of dragons. Wizards in the 10th circle are taught how to bend magic and have access to a form of meta magic. Wizards of this circle are told to guard this knowledge.

10th circle mages are recognized as exceptional masters of magic. A wizard who claims to be in the 10th circle found lying is put to death. 10th circle wizards have access to spells to transmute metals, stones, liquids, etc. They can copy spells from Nirys's library and can learn spells without spending any money.

## The Theif's Guild

Rogues, Assassins, and thieves in Volaris are an eclectic group. They are not required to join the guild, but guild membership has many perks and can be retained so long as a few simple rules are followed. 

Like the Circles of the Arcanist Nirys uses this as a way of filtering loyal members. 

### Rules:

*   **Do not steal from places of neutrality**. Marked with the theives guild insignia to avoid accidents certain places2 like shops, inns, taverns, etc. pay a protection fee to the guild to become places of neutrality.
*   **Do no harm in places of neutrality**. Locations of neutrality are considered safe, even if you have a writ to execute you should not attack a person in a place of neutrality.
*   **Protect the neutrality**. You are not expected to die, but if someone violates a place of neutrality you should fight the violator.
*   **Earn your reputation**. The theives guild will offer jobs to people based on their street rep. This means that a good theif will be approached to rob a certain home. A good assassin will be hired to kill a certain noble. A good mastermind will be recruited to plan a heist.
*   **Pay Your Debts**. It is possible to be in debt to the guild. Lighter punishments may be being stripped of membership until a debt is repaid.

### Perks:

*   **Fences**. Fences discretely move stolen goods. They do not ask questions. They usually pay a rate close to the value of the goods themselves and only take a small cut for themselves (3-10%). The fence makes money through volume of goods.
*   **Loans**. Redused interest loans. Instead of the 10-20% loans offered by most banks, low or no interest loans exist with punishments for violating terms that are beyond the bank (like losing a finger or your life).

**Arcane Recovery (8/day)**. Nirys restore all spent spell slots as if he had taken a long rest.

**Breath Control**. The dragon has exceptional control over its ability to breathe searing plasma. The Plasma Breath and Plasma Spear actions both use the dragonâ€™s shored up plasma reserve, so if one ability is used, it must recharge before the other can be used.

**Charismatic Arcanist**. Nirys may draw on any spell from the wizard spell list as though he were a 20th level wizard but may use his Charisma modifier instead of his Intelligence (DC 28, +20 to hit).

**Legendary Resistance (6/Day)**. If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead

------

### Actions

**Multiattack**. The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes four attacks: one with its bite, two with its claws, and once with its tail, it then casts a spell of 7th level or lower without using a spell slot.

**Bite**. Melee Weapon Attack: +20 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 23 (2d12 + 10) piercing damage plus 18 (4d8) fire damage.

**Claw**. Melee Weapon Attack: +20 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 19 (2d8 + 10) slashing damage.

**Frightful Presence**. Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 240 ft. of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Plasma Breath (Recharge 3-6)**. The dragon exhales crackling energy in a 120-foot cone, or a 240-foot line. Each creature in that area must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw, taking 140 (40d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Fire damage dealt by the dragonâ€™s breath bypasses fire resistance, but not immunity. All creatures within 90 feet of the dragon that can see it must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1d6 rounds.

**Plasma Spear (Recharge 3-6)**. Ranged Spell Attack: +20 to hit, reach 600/1,200 ft., one creature. Hit: 140 (40d6) fire damage. Fire damage dealt by the dragonâ€™s breath bypasses fire resistance, but not immunity. This attack ignores any cover bonus to AC benefiting the target except for cover bonuses granted by objects made of adamantine. The target must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction is permanent unless undone with magic such as the Greater Restoration spell. On a critical hit, this attack severs one of the targetâ€™s limbs, if it has any.

**Tail**. Melee Weapon Attack: +20 to hit, reach 20 ft., one creature. Hit: 21 (2d10 + 10) bludgeoning damage.

------

### Legendary Actions

Nirys can take up to 8 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creatureâ€™s turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of their turn.

**Command**. The dragon bellows a command to one of its allies within 360 feet. The chosen creature can immediately take one action.

**Detect**. The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Tail Attack**. The dragon makes a tail attack.

**Plasma Breath (Costs 3 Actions)**. Nirys exhales crackling energy in a 120-foot cone, or a 240-foot line. Each creature in that area must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw, taking 140 (40d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Fire damage dealt by the dragonâ€™s breath bypasses fire resistance, but not immunity. All creatures within 90 feet of the dragon that can see it must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1d6 rounds.

**Plasma Spear (Costs 3 Actions)**. Ranged Spell Attack: +20 to hit, reach 600/1,200 ft., one creature. Hit: 140 (40d6) fire damage. Fire damage dealt by the dragonâ€™s breath bypasses fire resistance, but not immunity. This attack ignores any cover bonus to AC benefiting the target except for cover bonuses granted by objects made of adamantine. The target must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction is permanent unless undone with magic such as the Greater Restoration spell. On a critical hit, this attack severs one of the targetâ€™s limbs, if it has any.

**Spell**. Nirys casts a spell ignoring the time requirement and without using a spell slot.

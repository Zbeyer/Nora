When removing enemies from an encounter a DM should start with the lowest CR and work up.

Finding a gem is much like finding a stack of gold and requires no effort to spend the value of the item.

**Elemental Demise.** If the Voltara dies, it explodes in a burst of lightning and thunder. Each creature within 30 feet of it must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 55 (10d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Lore**
Voltaras are titanic elementals born from the heart of tempests. They are embodiments of the storm's fury, often found in the midst of the most violent thunderstorms, where they dance among the crashing waves and lightning strikes. Sailors and coastal dwellers both fear and revere these creatures, for they are harbingers of destruction and yet, paradoxically, bringers of life-giving rain.

**Lore** 

The **Netherforge Technolich** is a being born from the fusion of ancient necromancy and cutting-edge Arcane technology. Once a brilliant mage and inventor, the individual who would become the Netherforge Technolich was obsessed with the pursuit of eternal life and the ultimate knowledge of both magic and machinery. Delving into forbidden texts and experimenting with dangerous aetheric energies, this mage discovered a way to bind their soul not just to a phylactery, but to the very essence of arcana itself.

As the mage’s mortal form withered, their consciousness was transferred into a mechanical body, powered by dark magic and aetheric currents. This transformation was not without cost; it twisted the mage’s ambition into a relentless drive for power and control over both the living and the dead. The Netherforge Technolich’s phylactery became a complex device, a marvel of arcane engineering that is nearly indestructible, hidden away in the heart of a labyrinthine factory fortress that continuously churns out undead constructs and arcane machines.

The Netherforge Technolich’s existence is a testament to the dangers of unchecked ambition and the volatile nature of combining magic and technology. It is said that the Technolich continues to expand its knowledge and power, seeking to impose its will upon the world of the living and the dead, turning the land into an extension of its mechanized domain.

Adventurers who dare to confront the Netherforge Technolich must not only face its formidable magical and technological prowess but also navigate the treacherous environment of its fortress, filled with traps, guardians, and the ever-present hum of dark energy that permeates the air. The Technolich’s influence can be felt across the land, as it seeks to spread its dominion and reshape the world in its image of a perfect fusion between the arcane and the mechanical.

# Order of the Arcane Vanguard

The Arcane Vanguard (AV) or Order of the Arcane Vanguard is an adventuring guild. Individuals can register a party, take requests or "quests," and covert creature and plant components into coins. The AV establishes itself in major cities. Jobs, contracts, and quests are assigned a difficulty and can be taken by a party dependent on their guild rank. Guild rank determines the limit a party can perform, thus a silver ranked part can still take a copper quest but cannot take a gold one, for example. Rank is increased based on how well persons perform in the quest, if a low rank party exceeds expectations on an low rank quest they may be promoted several ranks. Generally quests are ranked as follows:

|    Rank    | CR Estimation |       GP / Quest |
| :--------: | ------------: | ---------------: |
| Porcelain  |         1 & 2 |               10 |
|   Copper   |         3 & 4 |               20 |
|   Bronze   |         5 & 6 |               30 |
|    Iron    |         7 & 8 |               50 |
|   Silver   |        9 & 10 |               80 |
|    Gold    |       11 & 12 |              120 |
|  Platinum  |       13 & 14 |              180 |
|  Mithril   |       15 & 16 |              240 |
| Orichalcum |       17 & 18 |              280 |
| Adamantine |           19+ | 300 (negotiable) |

The rankings are a guideline, the AV doesn't know what might happen in a Silver dungeon, for example, so the party is expected to relay additional information when they debrief the guild and get paid.

# Encounter Examples

## Encounter: The Cursed Orchard `CR 1`

**Setting**: An old orchard where the trees have become twisted and the fruit has turned sour due to a curse.

**Guardian**: A **Scarecrow** (CR 1) animated by dark magic, it patrols the orchard, attacking anyone who dares to steal the cursed fruit.

**Monsters**:

-   4 **Kobolds** (CR 1/8 each): These small draconic creatures have taken up residence in the orchard, using the scarecrow as a distraction to ambush trespassers.

**Environmental Challenge**: The orchard is difficult terrain due to the overgrown plants and uneven ground. Additionally, the cursed fruit can release a toxic gas when disturbed, potentially causing nausea.

**Thematic Twist**: The orchard was once the pride of a local druid, now gone mad. The druid cursed the land in a fit of rage after the village nearby turned away from the old nature traditions.

**Objective**: The adventurers must lift the curse by finding the druid’s hidden talisman within the orchard and either destroying it or convincing the druid to revoke the curse.

**Final Gotcha**: Upon lifting the curse, the scarecrow collapses into a pile of straw and the kobolds flee. However, the druid, grateful for the removal of the curse, may offer the party a reward or further adventure opportunities.

## Encounter: The Forgotten Shrine `CR 2`

**Setting**: A small, overgrown shrine dedicated to a nature deity, now corrupted by a dark presence.

**Guardian**: A **Twig Blight** (CR 1/8) has taken root near the shrine, animated by the dark energy and attacking anyone who approaches.

**Monsters**:

-   2 **Needle Blights** (CR 1/4 each): These creatures hide among the trees, launching needles at the party.
-   1 **Vine Blight** (CR 1/2): This blight attempts to grapple and restrain the adventurers with its vines.

**Environmental Challenge**: The area around the shrine is difficult terrain due to the overgrowth and uneven ground. Additionally, the shrine emits a toxic pollen that can cause sneezing and coughing, potentially giving away the party’s position or interrupting spellcasting.

**Thematic Twist**: The shrine, once a beacon of natural harmony, is now a source of corruption. The blights are not just guardians but also victims of the shrine’s fall from grace.

**Objective**: The adventurers must cleanse the shrine by finding the source of the corruption—a small, cursed idol—and removing it from the altar.

**Final Gotcha**: Upon removing the idol, the blights’ aggression ceases, and they collapse into lifeless plants. However, the idol begins to pulse with dark energy, and the party must decide quickly how to dispose of it before the corruption spreads further.

## Encounter: The Thieves’ Market Ambush `CR 3`

**Setting**: The bustling Thieves’ Market, hidden in plain sight within the city. It’s a place where stolen goods are traded, and the local thieves’ guild keeps a watchful eye.

**Guardian**: A **Disguised Guard** (CR 1/8) posing as a beggar at the entrance, secretly alerting the guild of any trouble or unfamiliar faces entering the market.

**Monsters**:

-   4 **Bandits** (CR 1/8 each): These low-level thugs are the first line of defense, blending in with the crowd until they strike.
-   1 **Bandit Captain** (CR 2): The leader of the group, skilled in combat and tactics, commands the bandits from a hidden vantage point.

**Environmental Challenge**: The crowded market is difficult terrain, filled with stalls and unsuspecting civilians. The thieves use the chaos to their advantage, attempting to steal from the party or plant incriminating items.

**Thematic Twist**: The market is under the protection of a corrupt city official who gets a cut of the profits. The bandits are more organized and disciplined than typical street thugs.

**Objective**: The adventurers might be in the market to retrieve a stolen item, gather information, or on the trail of a fugitive hiding among the thieves.

**Final Gotcha**: As the encounter with the bandits concludes, the adventurers discover that the stolen item they’re after is a decoy, and the real item is still out there, leading to a chase across the rooftops of the city.
